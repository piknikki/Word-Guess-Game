# Word-Guess-Game
JavaScript basic project, week 2/3

In this game, you will try to guess the word.  Pick a letter, one-at-a-time, and you'll be told whether it's in the word or not.  If it is, it will take up it's appropriate space in the word.  If not, it will go into the Nope Bin.  If you guess the same letter more than once, nothing will change (so if there is more than one instance of a letter, all instances will appear in the word.  The number of guesses allowed will be one more than then length of the word.

If you guess all the letters in the word, you'll "win" that round, which will be reflected in your score.  If you can't get it within the allowed number of guesses, you will lose that round.
